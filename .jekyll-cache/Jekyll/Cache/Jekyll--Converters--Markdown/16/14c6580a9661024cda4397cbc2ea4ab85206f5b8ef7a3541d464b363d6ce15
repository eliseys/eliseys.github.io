I"‡<p>For most my life with computers I have either used Windows 7 or Linux. Windows was great but once I finally decided to try Ubuntu I never went back. I tried out all sorts of Linux distros (ie. Elementary OS, Crunchbang, Linux Mint) but none of them seemed right for me. After doing some searching around and I came to the conclusion that I had to attempt the unthinkable, Arch Linux.</p>
